    <p>Back in the late 1980's &#40;I was 8 years old at the time&#41;. There were all these amazing and even at that time classic boardgames that were fun, family friendly and easily accessible to all. There was Ants In The Pants, Trouble, Connect Four, Chess, Checkers, Monopoly, Battleship and Clue just to name a few of my favorites. These games were absolutely <em><b>the best</b></em> at the time and I couldn't get enough of them...little did I know I'd still be playing boardgames as an adult some twenty-five years later!</p>
      
    <p>My experience with bigger, badder and way too complex boardgames began about seven years ago when I met the husband of one of my wife's co-workers. Brad was a total boardgame geek that had actually played boardgames at a super competitive national level. He was at one time ranked the top<a href="http://www.catan.com/"> Settlers of Catan</a> player in the nation. Anyway, during our first meeting I noticed he had a copy of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987/arkham-horrorArkham">Arkham Horror</a> sitting on the kitche table. He explained to me that he had been wanting to play the game for quite some time, but due the seemingly endless book of rules, no one in his family had really felt eager enough to jump in and play. Skip to a couple or so hours and 30 pages of rules later and we were ready to begin our first game...it was during this first game that my love of "real" boardgames was forged.</p>
    
    <p>I'll keep updating this page with more of my boardgame "adventures" so check back frequently for any updates!</p>
